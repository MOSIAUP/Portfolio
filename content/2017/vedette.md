Club Vedette is an interactive project taking a refreshing approach to a complex subject. A digital art project, standing halfway between a cheesy joke and a critic on the Internet of Things. Club vedette is in fact a old "Vedette" fridge converted into a nightclub. Operation is simple : pick your drink of choice, and the fridge will put on the adequate atmosphere for you. Techno, Jazz, Funk, Punk, all clich√©s are here.
Switches and an Arduino Uno hidden in the freezer detect the action on the drinks. A computer running Max MSP and Maxuino then controls the playlist. The music is played by some loud speakers hidden in the walls, and light is controlled through a DMX to USB interface.

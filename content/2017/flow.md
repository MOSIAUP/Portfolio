These generative posters is an ongoing series. They are drawn using algorithms inspired by genetic processes, such as evolution and reaction diffusion. Each of these posters is unique, but similar yet different versions can be generated in nitely. The images are drawn in Processing on my computer, and afterwards projected on a wall, where I reproduce every little dots with a marker. I am very attached to this process of taking me to choose the design I like the most, and then manually print it on paper. This way, even though in nite varia ons of the image can be generated at the click of a bu on, only a single, fixed version exists in the “real” world.

Well Tempered was created within the context of my work at [Humans since 1982](http://humnssince1982.com).

“Well Tempered Structure” is an interactive installation and first attempt to immerse into and play with properties of our kinetic project A million Times.
The installation merges tangible and intangible, visible and invisible. As the many clock-hands of A million Times follow pre-programmed orders from a computer, the hundreds of concrete sticks in this installation follow directly ones movements, leaving the participant with a feeling of power and airiness where (virtual) reality follows commands by a single gesture. Presented as both a screen based piece and a virtual reality installation, the spectator has the choice to either watch or create.
